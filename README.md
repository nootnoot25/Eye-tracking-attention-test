This is my final year project where I added an eye-tracker into a continuous performance test used for ADHD testing.

There will be blue squares, and red squares, when the red square appears, press your spacebar, when the blue square appears
look directly at the square. 

To run this, you need to have pygame and other necessary libraries installed.
